# Lethal Company - ReHoster

This mod is for modpacks, what this mod achieves is making the player Re-Host Their Lobby to correctly load mods in the correct way.
Example, Weather Tweaks fail to load/modify on first host, when Rehosting it suddenly is resolved.
This could also solve issues with other mods that fail to pull the lever to start the game.
